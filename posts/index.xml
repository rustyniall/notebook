      <description>why does this site look like the BBC Micro game Granny&amp;rsquo;s Garden but without the charming pixel art? I&amp;rsquo;ve always been attracted to some retro aesthetics with my online stuff and normally can&amp;rsquo;t resist a good typewriter font. This is probably because I started out as a serious writer with a typewriter and I often get nostalgic about those early days and the creative frenzy that accompanied them. But this site isn&amp;rsquo;t about being a serious writer, it&amp;rsquo;s about playing around and there&amp;rsquo;s something about the 8/16 bit computer font that, for me, accentuates this playfulness.</description>

      <description>Hello, this is the notes section for my website, though it also functions as a kind of website within itself, hence the separate url. This is a home for all the posts that might not make the main section, sometimes because they are social media posts and other times becase they&amp;rsquo;re first drafts or fragments. They will run the gamut from microblogging to poems and early drafts and anything else of a more ephemeral nature.</description>

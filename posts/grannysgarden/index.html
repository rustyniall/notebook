<p>I&rsquo;ve always been attracted to some retro aesthetics with my online stuff and normally can&rsquo;t resist a good typewriter font. This is probably because I started out as a serious writer with a typewriter and I often get nostalgic about those early days and the creative frenzy that accompanied them. But this site isn&rsquo;t about being a serious writer, it&rsquo;s about playing around and there&rsquo;s something about the 8/16 bit computer font that, for me, accentuates this playfulness. It also reminds me of all the Indie, Pico-8 and Bitsy games that seem to push the imagination further because of the boundaries they have to work through. I&rsquo;m also reminded of afternoons copying code in BASIC from a page of a magazine into a ZX81 or Spectrum in the hope that, if I got it all right, a game would suddenly come into being from all that inpenetrable syntax. I guess that also takes me back to those typrewriter days spent hammering out words in the hope that something magical would happen.</p>

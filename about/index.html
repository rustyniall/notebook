<p>I am a poet, editor, event host and university lecturer. I live in London with my wife and kids and like to keep a low profile these days.</p>
<h1 id="about-this-site">About this site</h1>
<p>This site is the unruly sibling of my main website, <strong><a href="http://niallosullivan.co.uk">niallosullivan.co.uk</a></strong>. Whereas my main site functions as a typical website with info about me as well as blog posts and poems, this is more of a place for me to post the kind of ephemera and trifles that might find their way onto my social feeds. It&rsquo;s also a place for posts that might read like early drafts as well as throwaway poems and aborted ideas. This is a place where I can write and share things without worrying about maintaining standards and keeping up appearances.</p>
<h1 id="why-does-this-site-look-like-the-bbc-micro-game-grannys-garden-but-without-the-charming-pixel-art">why does this site look like the BBC Micro game Granny&rsquo;s Garden but without the charming pixel art?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been attracted to some retro aesthetics with my online stuff and normally can&rsquo;t resist a good typewriter font. This is probably because I started out as a serious writer with a typewriter and I often get nostalgic about those early days and the creative frenzy that accompanied them. But this site isn&rsquo;t about being a serious writer, it&rsquo;s about playing around and there&rsquo;s something about the 8/16 bit computer font that, for me, accentuates this playfulness. It also reminds me of all the Indie, Pico-8 and Bitsy games that seem to push the imagination further because of the boundaries they have to work through. I&rsquo;m also reminded of afternoons copying code in BASIC from a page of a magazine into a ZX81 or Spectrum in the hope that, if I got it all right, a game would suddenly come into being from all that inpenetrable syntax. I guess that also takes me back to those typrewriter days spent hammering out words in the hope that something magical would happen.</p>
<h1 id="contact">contact</h1>
<p>There is a contact form on <strong><a href="http//niallosullivan.co.uk">my main website</a></strong></p>
<p>I can sometimes be a bit rubbish at replying to email, it&rsquo;s nothing personal, as said above, I like to keep a low profile and have a tendency to vanish into my own cave.</p>
